# Implementation

def getFirstAndLast(array): # To declare function in JS we use const name  = () =>
  first = ages[0] # This line is the same in JS
  last = ages[-1] # To find last element in array in JS we use 'length-1'
  return first, last # This line is the same in JS

# Usage

ages = [10, 12, 15, 15, 17, 18, 18, 19, 20] # This line is the same in JS
first, last = getFirstAndLast(ages) # This line is the same in JS
print({ 'first': first, 'last': last }) # To print elements in JS we use 'console.log'
